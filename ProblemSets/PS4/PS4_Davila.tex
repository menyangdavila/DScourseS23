\maketitle
I am interested in web scraping public companies' proxy statements from the SEC EDGAR database. Public companies must file their proxy statements with the SEC before soliciting shareholder votes on matters such as the election of directors and approval of corporate actions. These statements disclose information about the company's voting procedures, nominated candidates for board of directors, and compensation of directors and executives. My goal is to analyze this information across and within companies, identify codification trends, and gain insights into corporate governance.
